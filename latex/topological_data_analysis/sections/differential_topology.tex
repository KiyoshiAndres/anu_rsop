	The idea of Morse theory is that you can obtain some information about a geometric space from the functions defined on it. For example, we can have unbounded continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$, yet this is not possible in $S^1$ since it is compact \cite{matsumoto2002introduction}.
	
	Smooth manifolds, functions between smooth manifolds, and other smooth manifold concepts are defined as in \cite[150]{lee2003introduction}. We will usually assume functions $f$ of manifolds to be smooth, or at least twice differentiable so that their Hessians exist.
	
	\begin{definition}
		A critical point $p_0\in M$ is said to be \textbf{non-degenerate} for the function $f$ if its \textbf{Hessian} 
		\begin{equation}
			H_f=
		\end{equation}
		
		
		$H_f(p_0)$ has non-zero determinant at $p_0$.
	\end{definition}
	
	I would like to keep some visual examples on hand. To that end, consider the following surfaces:
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\input{../figures/image_01.pgf}
		\end{center}
		\caption{A surface given by the equation $Z=$}
	\end{figure}

	\end{example}
	
	\begin{example}
		
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{definition}
		
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{example}
		Let's check that the definition of a vector field on a manifold indeed generalizes the definition on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{definition}
		A function $f$ is said to be \textbf{morse} if all its critical points are non-degenerate.
	\end{definition}
