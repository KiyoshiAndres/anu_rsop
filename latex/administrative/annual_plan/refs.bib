	abstract = {Abstract Topological persistence is a powerful and general technique for characterizing the geometry and topology of data. Its theoretical foundations are over 15 years old and efficient computational algorithms are now available for the analysis of large digital images. We explain here how quantities derived from topological persistence relate to other measurements on porous materials such as grain and pore-size distributions, connectivity numbers, and the critical radius of a percolating sphere. The connections between percolation and topological persistence are explored in detail using data obtained from micro-CT images of spherical bead packings, unconsolidated sand packing, a variety of sandstones, and a limestone. We demonstrate how persistence information can be used to estimate the percolating sphere radius and to characterize the connectivity of the percolating cluster.},

	abstract = {Quantitative features that can currently be obtained from medical imaging do not provide a complete picture of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). In this paper, we introduce a novel analytical tool based on persistent homology that extracts quantitative features from chest CT scans to describe the geometric structure of the airways inside the lungs. We show that these new radiomic features stratify COPD patients in agreement with the GOLD guidelines for COPD and can distinguish between inspiratory and expiratory scans. These CT measurements are very different to those currently in use and we demonstrate that they convey significant medical information. The results of this study are a proof of concept that topological methods can enhance the standard methodology to create a finer classification of COPD and increase the possibilities of more personalized treatment.},

	abstract = {A shortcoming of persistent homology is that when two domains have different numbers of components or holes the persistence diagrams of any filtration will have an infinite distance between them. We address this issue by revisiting the theory of extended persistence, initially developed by Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner and Harer in 2009 to quantify the support of the essential homology classes for Morse functions on manifolds. We simplify the mathematical treatment of extended persistence by formulating it as a persistence module derived from a sequence of relative homology groups for pairs of spaces. Then, for n-manifolds with boundary embedded in \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}\}{\textasciicircum}n\$\$, we use Morse theory to show that the extended persistent homology of a height function over M can be deduced from the extended persistent homology of the same height function restricted to \$\${\textbackslash}partial M\$\$. As an application, we describe the extended persistent homology transform (XPHT); a topological transform which takes as input a shape embedded in Euclidean space, and to each unit vector assigns the extended persistence module of the height function over that shape with respect to that direction. We define a distance between two shapes by integrating over the sphere the distance between the respective extended persistence modules. By using extended persistence we get finite distances between shapes even when they have different numbers of essential classes. We study the application of the XPHT to binary images; outlining an algorithm for efficient calculation of the XPHT exploiting relationships between the PHT of the boundary curves to the extended persistence of the foreground.},
